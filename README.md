## Installation

To install Neurologics in development mode, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neurologics.git
   cd neurologics
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the package in editable mode:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

This will install the package in "editable" mode, allowing you to make changes to the source code and immediately see the effects without having to reinstall the package.
